# Planning Process

## 1. Input Collection

- Feature requests come in from the website
- Bug reports come in from the website
- Internal ideas and experiments

## 2. Idea Capture

- New ideas are created as `plan.md` files in `.cursor/plans/`
- Each plan file contains: problem statement, goals, constraints, and initial scope

## 3. Plan Development

- Use multiple AI agents to explore the idea from different angles
- Generate alternative approaches and trade-offs
- Document findings in the plan file
- Assess feasibility and impact

## 4. Proof of Concept

- Build a POC with multiple AI agents based on the best plan
- Validate core assumptions
- Test technical approach
- Identify blockers early

## 5. Documentation & Analysis

- Document the best features that fit the project
- Document interesting ideas that might not fit (for future consideration)
- Capture learnings and insights

## 6. Scope Revision

- Revise scope based on POC findings
- Update plan with refined approach
- Prioritize features for implementation

## 7. Execution Decision

- Decide whether to proceed with implementation
- If proceeding: create actionable plan, tag stakeholders
- If deferring: archive plan with rationale

**Note:** `.cursor/plans/` is where all actionable plans live. Plans are living documents that evolve through the process.`docs/roadmap` is where all planning with be documented. Ideas and plans should always align with the roadmap
