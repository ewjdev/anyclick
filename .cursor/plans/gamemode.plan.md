# Game Mode

Specific elements on the page via scoped providers can have a new menu element "Game Mode". Game mode turns the current page into a game.

The game is a set of falling elements that are slow and get faster over time. The trick is for the cursor to not get hit by any element. If the cursor is hit then the game is over and the page goes back to normal. This needs to be as performant as possible and use the elements on the page that already exist
